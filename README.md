# meo backports
This repo contains backports for meo to older browsers.

Do not use or modify the `source` branch, it is an exact copy of meo with no modifications. Instead, use a branch with the name of the browser/OS you want to backport to.

## Backports
- `ios14` - Backports for iOS 14.2 and later, should work down to iOS 13 but untested. | [Open](https://ios14.meo-5d3.pages.dev) | [Source](https://github.com/MeowerBackports/meo/tree/ios14)
