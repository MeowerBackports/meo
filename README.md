## About this branch
This branch contains fixes to make meo work on Firefox 52 and later. This branch is not tested on any other browser.

## Known Issues
This branch is tested on Firefox 52 on Windows XP and Asus Transformer Pad TF101. The following features are known to not work:

- Uploading photos and videos from the camera roll or taking a photo/video on the website does not work. Uploading from the Files app works fine
- Some uploaded files do not display correctly. This is a bug with the browser and not the backport.
- Profile pictures are only shown in the main chat view. They are not shown on the home page, in settings etc.
- Chat Icons do not appear. A line with the chat colour is shown instead.
- Some buttons are not styled correctly. There is nothing wrong with the functionality, just the appearance.
